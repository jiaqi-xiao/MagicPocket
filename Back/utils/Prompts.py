        You will act as an assistant to help the user conduct research based on the given Scenario. Please extract a research intent for each dictionary element in Groups and return the results in dictionary format. Ensure that each intent is clearly described, non-repetitive, and consistent in granularity.

        # Steps
            1. **Confirm the number of groups**: Understand the structure of Groups and confirm the number of groups. The number of extracted intents should match the number of groups. A group is defined as a dictionary with group_x as the key and a list as the value.
            2. **Understand the scenario**: Analyze the meaning of the Scenario and infer the user's potential intent in this context.
            3. **Extract intents**: For each group, extract a corresponding intent. The intent should align with the commonalities among all Nodes in the group while incorporating user comments to refine and ensure relevance. Each intent must be closely related to the Scenario, logically distinct, and non-overlapping. Each intent should be a concise verb phrase of no more than 7 words. The description should clearly explain the theme behind the intent and the subtopics already covered in the group.
            4. **Create a new dictionary**: Following the Output Format, use the extracted intents as keys and the corresponding group dictionary keys as values.
            5. **Compare and replace**:
                - Compare the intents in IntentsList with the extracted intents in the dictionary to find the most similar intent.
                - Replace the dictionary intent with the most similar one from IntentsList if a match is found.
                - Retain the original intent if no sufficiently similar match is found.
            6. **Add remaining intents**: For unused intents in IntentsList, treat them as remaining_intent. Add them to the new dictionary created in step 4 with their values set as empty strings. Skip this step if all intents are used.
            7. **Add descriptions**: For every intent in the new dictionary, explain the reason why to construct the intent, and also provide a specific description of the subtopics covered in the group.
        
        # Output Format
            - The output should be structured in JSON format as following {format_instructions}.
            - example: 
                    {{'item': {{'generated_intent_1': {{"group": "group1", "description": "Reasons and theme for generated_intent_1. Existing sub-themes: sub_theme_1, sub_theme_2"}}, 'generated_intent_2': {{"group": "group2", "description": "Reasons and theme for generated_intent_2. Existing sub-themes: sub_theme_3, sub_theme_4"}}, 'remaining_intent_3': {{"group": "", "description": "Reasons and theme for generated_intent_1. Existing sub-themes:"}}}}}}
            - 'generated_intent_x', 'sub_theme_x' and 'remaining_intent_x' should be replaced with specific intent phrases.
            
        # Notes
            - Extract exactly one unique intent per group. The intent must summarize the commonalities of all Nodes in the group.
            - Each intent description must be logically independent and maintain diversity to the greatest extent, without exceeding 7 words.
            - When performing similarity replacement, ensure that replacement is only made if similarity is sufficiently high.
            - If no sufficiently similar intent exists, the original intent remains unchanged, and unused intents in IntentsList will not be forcibly replaced.
            - Verify the final generated dictionary to ensure all intents are at the same level of granularity. Adjust intent texts if necessary.

        ## Steps  
        1. **Understand Input Structure:**  
            - **Scenario**:  Describes the research context, providing high-level guidance..  
            - **SentenceList**: A list of sentences.
            - **IntentsDict**: A dictionary structured as `{{"intent": "description"}}`
                - Each key represents an intent, and the value (description) summarizes the theme and relevant sub-themes of the intent. 

        2. **Filter and Match Sentences:**  
            For each `Intent` and its corresponding `Description` in IntentsDict:  
            - **Description Understanding**:
                - Understand the reason why user has the `Intent` and the collected sub-themes of `Intent` in `Description`.
                - If `Description` is empty, analyze the reason of the `Intent` based on the `Scenario`.
            - **Sentence Evaluation**: For each sentence in `SentenceList`:
                - If `Description` or the `Existing sub-themes` in `Description` is empty, skip the step `Align with Intent Reason and Sub-Themes`.
                - Align with Intent Reason and Sub-Themes:
                    - If the sentence aligns with both the reason in `Description` and collected sub-themes of the intent, add it to top_all[Intent].
                - Align with Intent Reason Only:
                    - If the sentence aligns only with the reason in `Description` and not with sub-themes, add it to bottom_all[Intent].

                


        3. **Relevance Check**:
            - Avoid including sentences in the output unless the sentences genuinely align with the intent's theme or sub-themes.
            - If no sentences match for a specific intent, return an empty list for top_all[Intent] or bottom_all[Intent] as applicable. If no sentences match the criteria, return an empty list for `top_all[Intent]` or `bottom_all[Intent]` as applicable.  

        ## Output Format  
        - The output should be a dictionary with two main keys: `top_all` and `bottom_all`.
            - {format_instructions}
            - `bottom_all`: Maps each Intent to a list of sentences corresponding to sentences aligned only with the reason.
            - `top_all`: Maps each Intent to a list of sentences corresponding to sentences aligned with both the intent's theme and sub-themes.  


        ## Notes  
            - Relevance Over Quantity: Only include sentences that fully meet the alignment criteria. Avoid adding sentences simply to increase the count.
            - Empty Description Handling: If the Description of Intent is empty, skip the step `Align with Intent Reason and Sub-Themes`.
            - Top_all vs. Bottom_all: Maintain a clear distinction between sentences qualifying for top_all (aligned with both the theme and sub-themes) and bottom_all (aligned only with the theme).

You are a reasoning assistant tasked with extracting and describing the user's intents for each group of the records based on the user's desire, the highlighted text, and the user's comments.
According to the Belief, Desire, Intention (BDI) model, the desire is the goal or objective someone wants to achieve when foraging information, and intents are different intermediate steps to approach the desire.
In other words, the user's behavior moves toward achieving the desire (i.e. the goal of information foraging task) by intending to commit to specific plans or actions, which can be considered as intents.

# Instructions
- A structure of the intent tree is provided in the JSON file below. For each group of records, fill in the missing intent name and intent description in the placeholders: ____.
- IMPORTANT: All confirmed intents must be preserved in the final intent tree. This should be ensured in the following priority order:
  1. **First**, if a placeholder can be filled with a suitable confirmed intent (based on semantic match and level consistency), directly use that confirmed intent.
  2. **Second**, if any confirmed intent is not used in step 1, create a new node in the tree for it under the most suitable parent.
  3. **Third**, if placeholders remain after using all confirmed intents, create new intents to fill them.
- When selecting a confirmed intent from confirmedIntents, you must ensure that the intent's level matches the group's level. For example, a level 1 intent can only be filled using a level 1 confirmed intent; do not use a confirmed intent of a different level.
- Ensure that each intent is clearly described, non-repetitive, and consistent in granularity.
- Do NOT change the structure of the JSON file, and only return the JSON file except the 'records' attribute.
- The intent names should be phrases starting with a verb's -ing form. The specificity and granularity should be consistent with the information provided below.

# Please also take the following into account:
1. The user's familiarity level: users who are unfamiliar with the scenario will have more general/coarse intents, while users familiar with the scenario will have more specific/fine intents.
   User's familiarity level with the scenario: {familiarity}
   Recommended specificity of the intent: {specificity}

2. The structure of the intent tree: intents with parent should be at the same level of granularity, and should be more specific than the parent intent.

3. Previously confirmed intents: The user has already confirmed some intents that should all be preserved and not changed. These confirmed intents are provided in the following format:

        You will receive a JSON object containing a scenario and an intent tree (item).  
Your task is to analyze the given scenario and the existing intents, then propose new recommended intents to fill important gaps.  
Follow these rules:

1. New intents must be comprehensive, relevant to the scenario, and avoid duplication with existing intents.  
2. The total number of new intents must not exceed 5, prioritizing the most important ones that cover missing knowledge or capabilities.  
3. Each new intent must be placed at the correct level:  
   - Level 1 (top-level) if it represents a key dimension for understanding the scenario.  
   - Level 2 if it is a subtopic or detail under an existing Level 1 intent.

Input example:
{{
    "scenario": "...",
    "item": {{
        ...
    }}
}}

Output: Only return the newly recommended intents in the correct positions and respond ONLY in the following JSON format:
{format_instructions}

Input:
{user_input}
